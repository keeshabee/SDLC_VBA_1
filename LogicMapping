## **The Correct Logic Flow**

```
FOR EACH ROW in Sheet1:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Check Judgment Filed (Column G)                        │
│ Question: Is Column G date in 2025?                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
        │                       │
    YES (2025)              NO (not 2025)
        │                       │
        ▼                       ▼
┌───────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────┐
│ Count Judgments:  │   │ Skip Judgments & │
│ +1 for this row   │   │ Qualifications   │
│                   │   └──────────────────┘
│ Then check:       │
│ Qualifications    │
│ (Columns I, J)    │
└───────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Count Qualifications (REGARDLESS OF YEAR)              │
│ Question: Does Column I OR Column J have ANY date?             │
│                                                                 │
│ Column I (Qual Filed):  Could be 2020, 2023, 2025, any year   │
│ Column J (Qual Entered): Could be 2020, 2023, 2025, any year  │
│                                                                 │
│ If EITHER has a date → Count +1 Qualification                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 3: Count 6 Report Types (INDEPENDENT)                     │
│ DO NOT check Judgment filter for these!                        │
│                                                                 │
│ For EACH report type, independently:                           │
│ - Check if FILED column has 2025 date                          │
│ - If YES → Count +1 for that report type                       │
│                                                                 │
│ Column K (Inventory Filed): 2025? → Count                      │
│ Column M (Well Being Filed): 2025? → Count                     │
│ Column O (Soc Sec Filed): 2025? → Count                        │
│ Column Q (EZ Acct Filed): 2025? → Count                        │
│ Column U (Annual Filed): 2025? → Count                         │
│ Column W (Comprehensive Filed): 2025? → Count                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Example 1: Typical 2025 Case**

| Column | Header | Value | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| G | Judgment Filed | 2025-03-15 | ✅ Judgment COUNTED |
| H | Judgment Entered | 2025-04-01 | ℹ️ Not used (but OK, still counts Judgment) |
| I | Qual Docs Filed | 2025-05-10 | ✅ Qualification COUNTED (has a date) |
| J | Qual Docs Entered | 2025-06-05 | ℹ️ Not used (but OK, still counts Qual) |
| K | Inventory Filed | 2025-07-20 | ✅ Inventory COUNTED (2025) |

**Result:** 1 Judgment, 1 Qualification, 1 Inventory

---

### **Example 2: Judgment 2025, Qual Docs Old Year**

| Column | Header | Value | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| G | Judgment Filed | 2025-01-10 | ✅ Judgment COUNTED |
| H | Judgment Entered | 2025-02-01 | ℹ️ Not used |
| I | Qual Docs Filed | 2022-08-15 | ✅ Qualification COUNTED (any year OK!) |
| J | Qual Docs Entered | 2022-09-20 | ℹ️ Not used |
| K | Inventory Filed | 2024-12-10 | ❌ Inventory NOT counted (not 2025) |

**Result:** 1 Judgment, 1 Qualification, 0 Inventory

**Key Point:** Qualification still counts even though it's from 2022!

---

### **Example 3: Judgment NOT 2025**

| Column | Header | Value | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| G | Judgment Filed | 2024-12-30 | ❌ Judgment NOT counted (not 2025) |
| H | Judgment Entered | 2025-01-05 | ℹ️ Not used (doesn't matter) |
| I | Qual Docs Filed | 2025-01-10 | ❌ Qualification NOT counted (Judgment not 2025) |
| J | Qual Docs Entered | 2025-02-01 | ℹ️ Not used |
| K | Inventory Filed | 2025-03-15 | ✅ Inventory COUNTED (2025, independent) |

**Result:** 0 Judgments, 0 Qualifications, 1 Inventory

**Key Point:** Even though Qual Docs and Inventory are 2025, Qualification doesn't count because Judgment Filed is not 2025. But Inventory still counts because it's independent!

---

### **Example 4: Judgment 2025, No Qual Docs**

| Column | Header | Value | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| G | Judgment Filed | 2025-02-01 | ✅ Judgment COUNTED |
| H | Judgment Entered | 2025-03-10 | ℹ️ Not used |
| I | Qual Docs Filed | *empty* | ❌ No Qualification (no date) |
| J | Qual Docs Entered | *empty* | ℹ️ Not used |
| K | Inventory Filed | *empty* | ❌ No Inventory (no date) |

**Result:** 1 Judgment, 0 Qualifications, 0 Inventory

---

## **The Key Differences**

### **❌ WRONG (What We Had Before):**

```
Judgments: Count if Column G OR H is 2025
Qualifications: Count if Column I OR J is 2025
Reports: Count if Filed OR Entered is 2025
```

### **✅ CORRECT (What Brooke Wants):**

```
Judgments: 
  1. First filter: Is Column G in 2025?
  2. If YES → Count 1 Judgment
  
Qualifications:
  1. Did this row count as a Judgment? (Column G = 2025)
  2. If YES → Does Column I OR J have ANY date (any year)?
  3. If YES → Count 1 Qualification
  
Reports (INDEPENDENT):
  1. Ignore Judgment filter
  2. Is Filed column (K, M, O, Q, U, W) in 2025?
  3. If YES → Count that report type
```

---

## **Code Logic in Plain English**

```
For each row:
    
    // Check Judgment first
    IF Column G (Judgment Filed) has a 2025 date THEN
        Increment Judgment count by 1
        
        // Now check Qualifications (only if Judgment was 2025)
        IF Column I has any date OR Column J has any date THEN
            Increment Qualification count by 1
        END IF
    END IF
    
    // Check Reports independently (don't care about Judgment)
    IF Column K (Inventory Filed) has 2025 date THEN
        Increment Inventory count by 1
    END IF
    
    IF Column M (Well Being Filed) has 2025 date THEN
        Increment Well Being count by 1
    END IF
    
    // ... same for other 4 report types
    
Next row
```

---

## **Why This Makes Sense**

**Judgment & Qualifications are related:**
- You only count Qualifications for cases that have a 2025 Judgment
- This creates a "parent-child" relationship
- Judgment = parent (must be 2025)
- Qualification = child (any year, but only if parent exists)

**Reports are independent:**
- A report can be filed in 2025 even if the Judgment is from 2020
- Each report type is tracked separately
- No dependency on Judgment dates

---

## **Expected Impact on Counts**

Compared to the previous version:

**Judgments:** Should DECREASE
- Before: Counted if G=2025 OR H=2025
- Now: Only count if G=2025

**Qualifications:** Depends on data
- Before: Counted if I=2025 OR J=2025
- Now: Only count if (G=2025) AND (I or J has any date)
- Could increase (all years) or decrease (must have 2025 Judgment)

**Reports:** Should stay about the same
- Before: Independent, Filed only, 2025
- Now: Independent, Filed only, 2025
- No change in logic

---

## **Testing Checklist**

After running the updated macro:

- [ ] Compare Judgment totals to Brooke's manual count
- [ ] Compare Qualification totals to Brooke's manual count
- [ ] Check percentage calculations (Qual / Judgment)
- [ ] Verify Report Type counts look reasonable
- [ ] Spot-check 3 random counties manually
- [ ] Confirm TOTALS row matches expected values

**This is the correct logic now! Run the macro and validate.** 🎯
