Subject: Ready to Start Clearance Rate Macro - Quick Clarifications Needed

Hi Brooke,

I'm ready to start working on the Clearance Rate macro (Macro #3). I have the Master_Completed New Report Reviews file and sample exports from Report Review for weeks 10/20-10/26 and 10/27-11/2, so I'm all set on the data side.

I just need a few quick clarifications before I start building:

**Workflow Questions:**
- Which day of the week do you typically run these reports? (I know you mentioned it, but I want to make sure I have it right)
- Do your weeks run Sunday-Saturday, Monday-Sunday, or another schedule?
- Should the macro calculate one week at a time or handle multiple weeks at once?

**Confirming the Data Logic:**
From our call and looking at the Time to Entry data, the four financial reports that go to volunteers are:
1. Inventory (Column L - Entered)
2. EZ Accounting (Column R - Entered)
3. Annual Report (Column V - Entered)
4. Comprehensive Accounting (Column X - Entered)

Can you confirm that:
- These are the correct columns (L, R, V, X)?
- I should be using the **Entered** dates (when uploaded to system), not Filed dates?
- Unlike Macros 1 and 2, these reports should NOT be filtered by the 2025 Judgment dates - they should count all reports entered within the week regardless of when judgments were filed, correct?

Once I have these confirmations, I can start building. Let me know if you'd prefer a quick call to discuss!

Thanks,
Keisha
